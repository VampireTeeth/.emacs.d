# -*- mode: org; -*-

* Purpose of the repo
Only han-mode.el is written by me, the others are not maintained any
more and I find them very useful. In some cases I have made some
customisations of my own. And I have customised org-mode and emacs
quite a bit, hence this repository. :)

* Disclaimer
I use several 3rd party libraries. The configuration for these are
included in this repo, however I don't include them here (as I don't
want to imply I am one of the authors). The libraries outside the repo
are simlinked from lisp/. If you want to use them, you will have to
get them from the corresponding home pages. They are usually available
from the emacswiki or emacswiki git mirror.
