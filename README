# -*- mode: org; -*-

* Purpose of the repo
Only han-mode.el is written by me, the others are not maintained any
more and I find them very useful. In some cases I have made some
customisations of my own. And I have customised org-mode and emacs
quite a bit, hence this repository. :)

* Disclaimer
I use several 3rd party libraries. The configuration for these are
included in this repo, however I don't include them here (as I don't
want to imply I am one of the authors) unless the original libraries
have been orphaned. The libraries outside the repo are simlinked from
lisp/. If you want to use them, you will have to get them from the
corresponding home pages. They are usually available from the
emacswiki or emacswiki git mirror.

* 3rd party libraries
Here is an incomprehensive list:

Libraries outside the repo:
- auto-complete
- dired-details
- dired-details-plus
- doxymacs
- egg
- emacs-calfw
- git-commit-mode
- google-contacts
- google-weather-el
- icicles
- minimal
- undo-tree

Orphaned libraries:
- browse-kill-ring
- session[fn:1]

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Since the homepage for session.el has gone offline, I have
       added this to the repo just to serve as a mirror.
